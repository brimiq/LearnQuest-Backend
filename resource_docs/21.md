# GitHub Actions Tutorial — Lesson Notes

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform built into GitHub. It automates workflows like testing, building, and deploying code every time you push or create a pull request.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Workflow** | An automated process defined in a YAML file |
| **Event** | A trigger (push, pull_request, schedule, etc.) |
| **Job** | A set of steps that run on the same runner |
| **Step** | An individual task (run a command or use an action) |
| **Runner** | A server that executes the workflow |

## Basic Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest --verbose
```

## Deploy Workflow

```yaml
  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy to server
        run: ssh user@server "cd /app && git pull && systemctl restart app"
        env:
          SSH_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}
```

## Secrets & Environment Variables

- Store sensitive data in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.
- Reference in workflows: `${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}`.
- Never hardcode API keys or passwords in workflow files.

## Key Takeaways

1. Workflows live in `.github/workflows/` as YAML files.
2. Use `needs:` to chain jobs (e.g., deploy only after tests pass).
3. Leverage the Actions Marketplace for pre-built actions.
4. Use branch protection rules to require CI checks before merging.

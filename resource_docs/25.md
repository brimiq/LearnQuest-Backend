# Expo Documentation — Reference Guide

## What is Expo?

Expo is a platform for building React Native apps with a managed workflow. It provides tools, libraries, and services that simplify mobile development.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Create a new project
npx create-expo-app@latest MyApp
cd MyApp

# Start development server
npx expo start

# Run on device
# Scan QR code with Expo Go app (iOS/Android)
```

## Project Structure

```
MyApp/
├── app/              # Screens (file-based routing)
│   ├── _layout.tsx   # Root layout
│   ├── index.tsx     # Home screen
│   └── profile.tsx   # Profile screen
├── components/       # Reusable components
├── assets/           # Images, fonts
├── constants/        # Theme, config
└── app.json          # Expo configuration
```

## Useful Expo SDK Libraries

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `expo-camera` | Camera access |
| `expo-location` | GPS location |
| `expo-notifications` | Push notifications |
| `expo-secure-store` | Encrypted storage |
| `expo-image-picker` | Photo gallery access |
| `expo-file-system` | File read/write |

## Building for Production

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Configure build
eas build:configure

# Build for Android
eas build --platform android

# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios

# Submit to stores
eas submit --platform android
eas submit --platform ios
```

## Key Takeaways

1. Expo Go lets you test on real devices without building native code.
2. Use `expo-router` for Next.js-style file-based navigation.
3. EAS Build handles native compilation in the cloud.
4. Eject with `npx expo prebuild` when you need custom native modules.

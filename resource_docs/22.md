# CI/CD Explained — Lesson Notes

## What is CI/CD?

- **CI (Continuous Integration):** Automatically build and test code every time a developer pushes changes. Catches bugs early.
- **CD (Continuous Delivery):** Automatically prepare releases for deployment. Every change that passes tests is ready to ship.
- **CD (Continuous Deployment):** Automatically deploy every passing change to production. No manual approval needed.

## The CI/CD Pipeline

```
Code Push → Build → Test → Stage → Deploy
   │          │       │       │        │
   └──────────┴───────┴───────┴────────┘
         Automated Pipeline
```

### Stages

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **Build** | Compile code, install dependencies, create artifacts |
| **Test** | Run unit tests, integration tests, linting |
| **Stage** | Deploy to a staging environment for QA |
| **Deploy** | Push to production (manual or automatic) |

## Popular CI/CD Tools

| Tool | Hosted By | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| GitHub Actions | GitHub | Built-in, YAML-based |
| GitLab CI/CD | GitLab | Built-in, powerful pipelines |
| Jenkins | Self-hosted | Highly customizable, plugin ecosystem |
| CircleCI | Cloud | Fast, Docker-native |

## Best Practices

1. **Run tests on every push** — never merge broken code.
2. **Keep builds fast** — parallelize tests, cache dependencies.
3. **Use feature branches** — isolate changes with pull requests.
4. **Automate everything** — linting, testing, security scans, deploys.
5. **Monitor after deploy** — use health checks and rollback strategies.

## Key Takeaways

1. CI catches bugs before they reach production.
2. CD ensures every passing build is deployable.
3. A good pipeline gives confidence to ship fast.
4. Start simple (build + test), then add stages incrementally.
